## Developer Notes

I chose to use create-react-app, just because it's quick and easy to get up and running. 
Also, I added TailwindCSS for easy styling + responsiveness. It's very "class-heavy" but a willing trade-off given the scope of the app. For the API layer, I cached a response from stubhub (it's in ./api/data.json). For simplicity sake, I assumed every ticket would be $100 per person (and a service fee per ticket as well).

## Starting App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
